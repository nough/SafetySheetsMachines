%: Intro
\machinePage{Makerspace}{NoMandatory}{
Observe all safety instructions. Instructions or approval is required for some of the machines. Ask someone for help, consult the wiki or email the mailing lists when in doubt.

Ask for instructions if you are unfamiliar on how to use a tool. This is to protect you and to protect the tool. This is a shared space -- consider others around you before using a machine; and be aware of others working nearby.  Leave the space cleaner than you found it.

Make sure you know where the \textbf{emergency stops and fire extinguishers} are. In case of "call 112"-type emergencies, make sure there is someone at the door to let paramedics in. If you have to stay with the wounded, jam the doors open. Bring your key(card)s with you if you have to let emergency personnel in.
}{
\action{58}{Wear protective clothing}{Wear tight fitting clothing, keep long hair out tied up, no jewellery or anything else that can be caught by a machine. Consider that others may be working at the space -- and you may be in close range of their machines too.

%Be careful with gloves -- they can be caught in the machine and when made of a sturdy material, help rip your finger off. Observe the `no gloves' signs.
}
\action{56}{Wear appropriate footwear}{No sandals or similar in the main workspace.}
\action{64}{Wear a mask when needed}{Especially when cutting materials such as MDF}
\action{52}{Eye protection recommended}{Also consider that hard-metal cutters and ceramics can suddenly shatter.}
\action{57}{Protective gloves recommended}{But also: be careful with gloves -- they can be caught in the machine and when made of a sturdy material, help rip your finger off. }
\action{51}{Ear protection recommended}{And try to be considerate Neighbours--especially after 19:00.}
}{If something breaks or is amiss -- it is \textbf{your} responsibility to report it.  If you find something broken -- report it before using/repairing the machine.

\warn{124}{Machine can suddenly start}{%
	Machine can suddenly start moving; and can move under its own command (even when the PC is off -- rely on the emergency stop buttons.).
	
	It will also start moving without warning -- for example when the PC\&software are (re)started.}
\warn{125}{Crushing}{Risk of crushing -- the machine does not have any sensors that detect obstacles
This includes things such as your hands (do not lean on the blue rail) or tools you've left on the workspace.
}
}{
This machine contains commercial software which is locked to this specific hardware and OS install. Neither of which we can re-install (as we have no media and the suppliers have long gone out of business). So be very very careful with USB sticks and other media. A virus or malware may permanently kill this setup.

Only switch XYZ feeds when the machine is not running. Use the hand-wheel to get the gear fully locked in prior to starting the feed. Be sure to tighten all 4 nuts post rotating the head or all 4 nuts when moving the head laterally.

Try to avoid getting coolant or similar on the slide-ways -- especially the Y slipway between machine and table. Use a shield or adjust the flow. Machine needs to be cleaned post use.  When using coolant -- also empty the recess on the left of the table and clean out the t-Slots until dry.

Make sure you clamp your workpiece well - to avoid spinning.

Let the drill do its work - do not apply much pressure (drill gets dull or will snaps).

Use the correct drill speed (higher for aluminium, low for steel, very low for stainless steel (\textsc{rvs}). Use the table on the wall.

Use drilling oil when needed (when in doubt - always use the green oil).

\textbf{Drilling}: Use with common sense, do not drill in the metal of the XY table! Use the wooden overlay to protect it. 

\textbf{Milling}: Getting instructions \textbf{prior} to use is mandatory. After milling: put the machine back in order for drilling, so others can use it

\textbf{When changing the drillbit for milling: use a nylon hamerhead, do NOT use a metal hamer.  }

To adjust the height: 1) loosen the lower nut at the right back side of the machine (marked: 'deze moer' ). Then 2) use the big handle on the left side to crank up/lower the whole top part of the drill. \\
\textbf{And 3) fasten the nut again before drilling!}

For speed adjustment open the top and re-arrange the belts as shown on the diagram on the machine for the right speed. You can run these off/on the wheels by starting and ending with the larger of the two.
