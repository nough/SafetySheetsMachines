Observe all safety instructions. Instructions or Induction is required for some of the machines. Ask someone for help, consult the wiki or email the mailing lists when in doubt.

Ask for instructions if you are unfamiliar on how to use a tool. This is to protect you and to protect the tool. This is a shared space -- consider others around you before using a machine; and be aware of others working nearby.  Leave the space cleaner than you found it.

Make sure you know where the \textbf{emergency stops and fire extinguishers} are. In case of "call 112"-type emergencies, make sure there is someone at the door to let paramedics in. If you have to stay with the wounded, jam the doors open. Bring your key(card)s with you if you have to let emergency personnel in.
}{
\action{58}{Wear protective clothing}{Wear tight fitting clothing, keep long hair out tied up, no jewellery or anything else that can be caught by a machine. Consider that others may be working at the space -- and you may be in close range of their machines too.

%Be careful with gloves -- they can be caught in the machine and when made of a sturdy material, help rip your finger off. Observe the `no gloves' signs.
}
\action{56}{Wear appropriate footwear}{No sandals or similar in the main workspace.}
\action{64}{Wear a mask when needed}{Especially when cutting materials such as MDF}
\action{52}{Eye protection recommended}{Also consider that hard-metal cutters and ceramics can suddenly shatter.}
\action{57}{Protective gloves recommended}{But also: be careful with gloves -- they can be caught in the machine and when made of a sturdy material, help rip your finger off. }
\action{51}{Ear protection recommended}{And try to be considerate Neighbours--especially after 19:00.}
}{If something breaks or is amiss -- it is \textbf{your} responsibility to report it.  If you find something broken -- report it before using/repairing the machine.

Only switch XYZ feeds when the machine is not running. Use the hand-wheel to get the gear fully locked in prior to starting the feed. Be sure to tighten all 4 nuts post rotating the head or all 4 nuts when moving the head laterally.

Try to avoid getting coolant or similar on the slide-ways -- especially the Y slipway between machine and table. Use a shield or adjust the flow. Machine needs to be cleaned post use.  When using coolant -- also empty the recess on the left of the table and clean out the t-Slots until dry.

\textbf{Beware that this is a powerful, 3-phase (Krachtstroom), machine.}

So unlike the other pillar-drill - it won't stop of something jams.

Beware that the machine can start to spin if you press the green button while the rotary knob is set to 1 or 2. 

Only use the emergency button on the front for emergency stops. For routine on-off use the rotary knob. De-energise the machine with the red button when you are done.
